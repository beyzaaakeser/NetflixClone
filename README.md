<h1>My Netflix Clone Website</h1>

I developed a website similar to Netflix, a platform enriched with modern technologies and API integrations. In my project, dynamic movie data is retrieved using the TMDB API. The application developed with React (Vite) draws attention with its fast build time and high performance. I enabled users to navigate between pages smoothly with React-Router-Dom. Movie types can be easily filtered with React-Select.

Dynamic images and descriptions are displayed for each movie on the home page. In addition, when hovering over the movies, detailed information (photo, description, release date, movie type, etc.) can be accessed with the hover state. The movies, which are listed in slides, are instantly updated with user interaction. All pages work properly on every device with their mobile-compatible responsive design.

<h2> The following technologies were used in the frontend development phase of my site: </h2>

- API (TMDB)
- React (Vite)
